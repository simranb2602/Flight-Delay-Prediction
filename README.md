Overview:

Flight Delay Prediction is a machine learning project designed to predict the likelihood of flight delays using historical flight data and weather information. Delays in air travel cause significant inconvenience to passengers and financial losses for airlines. This project leverages machine learning techniques to help mitigate the impact of delays by providing accurate predictions.

Project Objective:

The primary objective of this project is to develop predictive models that can forecast flight delays based on key factors such as departure times, weather conditions, and airport traffic. By accurately predicting flight delays, airlines can optimize their operations, allocate resources effectively, and improve the overall travel experience for passengers.

Why This Project?

Flight delays cause missed connections, lost profits, and increased operational costs for airlines. For passengers, delays result in frustration and disrupted travel plans. This project addresses the need to:

1.Provide real-time insights into potential flight delays.

2.Help airlines manage schedules and reduce operational disruptions.

3.Enable passengers to make informed decisions and plan their travel more efficiently.

What’s Inside?

The project follows the CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) framework and consists of the following phases:

1.Business Understanding: Understanding the problem of flight delays and setting the project’s goals.

2.Data Understanding: Gathering and exploring historical flight and weather data.

3.Data Preparation: Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis and modeling.

4.Modeling: Building and testing various machine learning models such as Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier to predict flight delays.

5.Evaluation: Evaluating the performance of models using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC AUC.

6.Deployment: Implementing the model for real-time predictions and analysis.
